# ðŸŽ§ Video-to-Audio Converter : Kubernetes Microservices Project

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm working on this project to practice **DevOps** and **microservices deployment** using **Kubernetes**, **Docker**, and **AWS**. The app is a Python-based microservice that converts video files to audio format.

I built this project to:
- Understand how microservices architecture works in real-world deployments
- Practice containerization and orchestration using Kubernetes
- Deploy apps to AWS using EKS or a self-managed K8s cluster
- Strengthen my DevOps skills
